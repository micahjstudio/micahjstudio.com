My name is Micah, I'm an artist, a photographer, a writer, and a student. I'm currently studying architecture at Del Mar College.

I'm also a kind of ameteur coder, I've build a couple of basic websites like this one.

I built this website as a means of presenting myself to potential employers, at the moment I'm seeking a drafting job, in the future It will be for jobs as a lisenced architect.

you can find my photography as well at [micahjames.com](https://micah-james.com/).
